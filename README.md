# iFeeds - RSS Reader for iOS

This project is an **RSS Reader** that I developed as part of my Bachelorâ€™s thesis in 2012. It was originally built in **Objective-C** for iOS and reflects the state of iOS development at that time.

## Note

**Important Notice:**  
This project is **historical** and serves as documentation of my early work in iOS development. The code remains unchanged from its original form and does not adhere to modern best practices. Specifically:
- It was developed in **Objective-C**, which has since largely been replaced by **Swift**.
- It does not use modern iOS frameworks like **SwiftUI** or **Combine**.
- Architecture and design decisions may differ significantly from current standards.

## Planned Updates

In the future, I plan to revise and rewrite this project to:
- Migrate the codebase to **Swift**.
- Incorporate modern frameworks and technologies.
- Improve code quality and architecture.

## License and Usage

Feel free to use this code as a reference or inspiration, but please be aware that it no longer meets current development standards. Feedback and suggestions for future improvements are welcome!
